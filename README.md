# All-Biomes-Challenge

The All-Biomes-Challenge is a minecraft spigot plugin that allows you to track the biomes you have visited in your world.
You get one biome that you have to visit and if you visit it, you get a new one. The goal is to visit all biomes in your world.
The plugin is inspired by the [Basti-GHG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdElMK0mB5k) video.

The player data is stored in a json file in the plugin folder. The file is called `biomesFound.json` and contains the uuid of the player, the biomes he has already visited and the biome he needs to visit next.
